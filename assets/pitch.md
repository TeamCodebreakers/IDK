### Members
* Melfi Perez

### Summary of idea
* We want an Alexa Skill that suggests restaurants based on given options, by saying you don't know where you want to go.  
* This should hook into a dynamoDB Database with lambdas to save preferences.  

### What problem or pain point does it solve? 
* This eliminates the headache of trying to choose a restaurant when you don't know what you want to eat.  
* The intention is to reduce "hanger" and indecision about food choices, especially in group conversations.  

### Minimum MVP definition.What is the minimum required for you to present on your demo day?
* Alexa skill.
* Engaged invocation phrases.  
* With utterances which we capture and manipulate.  
* Yelp API to gather local restaurants.
* Uses the following AWS services:  
* Codestar. 
* DynamoDB.
* Lambda.
* IAM.
* S3.
