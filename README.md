### About the Application <a name="aboutapp"></a>

The "FeedMeNow" Skill eliminates the headache, "hanger", and indecision about choosing where you or a group want to eat! This Skill makes restaurant recommendations based on the Yelp API, by using the users' device location and narrowing it down to a 25 mile radius. Users are automatically enrolled in their own personal group & have the option to add and remove additional members from their group. Once a recommendation is selected Alexa will send an SMS text with the restaurant information to all memebers of the group.
