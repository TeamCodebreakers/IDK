### About the Application <a name="aboutapp"></a>

The "I don't know..." Skill eliminates the headache, "hanger", and indecision about choosing where you or a group want to eat! This Skill saves basic user preferences, asks the user to choose from two different food categories, pulls from the Yelp API, and gives back a suggestion following the users preferences.
